## Brief information about myself:

#### In the near future I plan to become a front-end developer and create high-quality and popular web interfaces and sites.

#### Started studying in early 2021. For this I have all the appropriate skills:

- the desire to learn new things;
- easy mastering of new skills;
- analytic mind;
- penchant for intellectual work.

####At the moment I earn by manual labor. Hence my goal number 1 is to change the field of activity.

####At the moment, I am already familiar with HTML and CSS3, learning the basics of JavaScript and other materials that make up the conceptual image of a front-end developer, according to Frontend Road Map 2021.

#### For a quick start, the course "Website Development in HTML and CSS for Beginners" _by Dmitry Valak_ was taken.

#### At the moment I'm going to study at The Rolling Scopes School (2021q1). Proficiency in English - _A2_.
